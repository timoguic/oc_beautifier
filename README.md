# OC beautifier

Use this script with TamperMonkey extension or as a developer extension in Chrome. It makes OC's dashboard
easier to use when you are a (validating) mentor. Use at your own risk.

## How to use
### Chrome extension
* Open `chrome://extensions/`
* Enable developer mode
* Click 'Load unpacked' and select the `extensions/chrome_ext` folder

### With TamperMonkey (slower)
* Install the [TamperMonkey extension](https://tampermonkey.net/)
* Open TamperMonkey dashboard
* Go to 'Utilities' tab
* Get the raw link to the script you want to install (e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timoguic/oc_beautifier/master/new_soutenance_enhancer.js`)
* Input that link in the 'URL' field, click 'Import' and then 'Install'

## Changelog
* 2018/12/06: added default template for "CR soutenance"
* somewhere in 2017: added link to student's profile
